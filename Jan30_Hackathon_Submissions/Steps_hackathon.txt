DS based approach:
1. Ghats has to be stored in some kind of data structure
2. Take Two inputs - ghat(string) & number of members(integer)
3. Check for ghat
4. Check for availability
5. Transactions if input are valid
6. Show other options if quantity is more than available
7. Ask to choose from other options
8. Repeat the process till a successful transaction
9. On a successful transaction, update the ghat with new availability
10. Exit the code

Non DS based approach:
1. Store each ghat as variable
2. Assign respective availability as integer
3. Take Two inputs - ghat(string) & number of members(integer)
4. Check for ghat
5. Check for availability
6. Transactions if input are valid
7. Show other options if quantity is more than available
8. Ask to choose from other options
9. Repeat the process till a successful transaction
10. On a successful transaction, update the ghat with new availability
11. Exit the code


Bonus:
1. Handle for integer values less than 0
2. Handle for integer values greater than a fixed number
3. Handle for "0 member allocation"
4. Handle for capital and small letters in input
